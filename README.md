# ðŸŽ® My No-Code Gamer Portfolio #

Hey there! Welcome to my portfolio website, built with absolutely zero lines of code (okay, maybe a few tweaks here and there ðŸ˜‰). Here's how I stitched it all together:
## ðŸ›  Built With ##

    bolt.new â€“ The no-code builder that made this entire site possible!

    Cloudinary â€“ All the pretty images you see? Hosted and optimized here.

    Supabase â€“ My backend/database magic. Fast, free, and open-source.

    Steam Integration â€“ Yes, my most-played games of the past 2 weeks update automatically. Because priorities.

    FormSubmit â€“ Want to say hi? Drop a message through the contact form â€“ no backend required.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why I Made This ##

I wanted a fun, fast, and functional way to show who I am â€“ as a dev, a gamer, and a human. This site is a little playground where tech meets personality.
